# email-db

An exploration into the MEAN stack

After a month of working with the first few projects in Alacrity, a common task involved was sending emails out to potential interested parties. Regardless of the outcome - the problem arose in the form of a question: 

'Have we emailed them already?'

Ah! A CRM you say? Of course! That's a totally viable, sensible, more secure, probably overall a 300% better idea than what I decided to do - and that was to build my own. 

It was during the period where we didn't have much development work to do. Very minimal as a matter of fact. So I decided to set out and learn a new stack, the MEAN stack. I think it's also referred to as a full JS stack? I mean it seems to make sense. It's **all** Javascript!

This project aimed to be the first internal tool that we'd develop. I say _we_ because my team-mate, Jake followed the same mindset of learning to build and use our own tools, but our business lead decided to go with an actual branded solution (of course I don't blame him either) but I still kept this around for my own personal development.


# Build!

You may need to install git, node, npm and bower.

Clone the project then run 

```npm install```
and 
```bower install``` 
then 
```node server.js``` to get a local server started.
